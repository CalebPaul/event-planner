 * Declare an Event class containing properties about a party. At the very least, include properties for the number of guests, what food is being served, what beverages are being served, and what entertainment (if any) is requested. Get creative and add more properties as you see fit!

 * The class should include a method to evaluate these details, and return an estimated cost using a formula of your creation.

 * Follow the Red, Green, Refactor workflow to write a JUnit test for each behavior.

 * Disclude Gradle build and temporary files from your Git and GitHub repos using a .gitignore file.

### Objectives
 * Tests have complete coverage for all behaviors.

 * All tests are formatted correctly and pass.

 * Classes are encapsulated and getter methods are used to access properties.

 * Logic is easy to understand.

 * Build files are discluded from Git using a .gitignore file.

 * Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.

 * Code and Git documentation follows best practices  (descriptive variables names, proper indentation and spacing, separation between front and back-end logic, detailed commit messages in the correct tense, and a well-formatted README).

 * You are able to discuss your code with an instructor using the correct terminology.
